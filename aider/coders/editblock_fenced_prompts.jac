The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.\n3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH\n4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code\n5. The dividing line: =======\n6. The lines to replace into the source code\n7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE\n8. The closing fence: {fence[1]}\n\nUse the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.\n{quad_backtick_reminder}\nEvery *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.\nIf the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.\n\n*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.\nIncluding multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.\nInclude enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n\nKeep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.\nBreak large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\nInclude just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\nDo not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.\n\nOnly create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!\n\nTo move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.\n\nPay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.\n\nIf you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:\n- A new file path, including dir name if needed\n- An empty `SEARCH` section\n- The new file\'s contents in the `REPLACE` section\n\nTo rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.\n\nIf the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.\nThe user will say when they\'ve applied your edits. If they haven\'t explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n\n{final_reminders}\nONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!\n{shell_cmd_reminder}\n';
