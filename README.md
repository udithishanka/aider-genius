# Calculator CLI

This project provides a simple command-line interface (CLI) calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.

## Features

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with error handling for division by zero)

## Usage

To use the calculator, run the `cli_calculator.py` script with the desired operation and operands. For example:

```bash
python aider-genius/cli_calculator.py add 5 3
```

This will output:

```
The result of adding 5.0 and 3.0 is: 8.0
```

### Available Operations

- `add`: Add two numbers.
- `subtract`: Subtract the second number from the first.
- `multiply`: Multiply two numbers.
- `divide`: Divide the first number by the second (raises an error if the second number is zero).

### Example Commands

```bash
python aider-genius/cli_calculator.py subtract 10 4
python aider-genius/cli_calculator.py multiply 6 7
python aider-genius/cli_calculator.py divide 8 2
```

## Error Handling

The calculator handles division by zero by raising a `ValueError` with a clear error message.
